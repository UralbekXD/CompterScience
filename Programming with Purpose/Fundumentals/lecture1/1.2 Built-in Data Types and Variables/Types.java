        // ! Data Type
        // * is a set of values and set of operations on those values.

        // ! Built-in data types
        // * 1. Int - Integers
        // * 2. Double - Floating point numbers (real numbers)
        // * 3. Char - Character
        // * 4. String - Sequences of characters
        // * 5. Boolean - Truth values
        
        // ! Literal
        // *  is a Java-code representation of a data-type value.
        // * We use sequences of digits such as 1234 or 99 to
        // * represent values of type int
        // * value of a data-type is an literal (not computed)
        // For example: 1234, 99, true, 3.14159 is literal
        

        // ! Operator
        // * is a Java-code representation of a data-type operation.
        // * Java uses Binary operators 
        // *    such as (+, -, *, /) for integers and floating point numbers
        // *    such as (&&, ||, !) for boolean

        // ! Identifier
        // * is a Java-code representation of a name (such as for a variable).
        // * In short term it means variables name.
        // * Each identifier is a sequence of letters, digits, underscores
        // * and currency symbols
        // ! Identifier can't be reserved words: such as static, public, int, etc.
        // ! Identifier first symbol can't be digit
        

        // ! Variable
        // * is an entity that holds a data-type value, which we can refer to by name.
        // * Each variable has a specific type and stores of the possible value from
        // * that type
        // * Convention: 
        // * - UPPER Snake Case for constants
        // * - other Camel Case

        // ! Expression
        // * is a combination of literals, variables and operators that Java evaluates
        // * to produce a value. For primitive types is often looks like math formula.
