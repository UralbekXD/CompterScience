# List of CS courses I have taken
- [Computer Science: Programming with Purpose](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-programming-java)  
    This course is introducing basic programming elements such as variables, conditionals, loops, arrays,  
    and I/O. Next, we turn to functions, introducing key concepts such as recursion, modular programming,  
    and code reuse. Then, we present a modern introduction to object-oriented programming.

    Lecturers: [Robert Sedgewick](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/~250165),
